🏔️ HIMALAYAN EXPEDITIONS - Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project is a data analytics case study on Himalayan expeditions, focusing on trends, patterns, and insights derived from expedition datasets. Using Tableau, I built interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore aspects such as:

📊 Number of expeditions over time

🧗 Success & failure rates of climbs

🌍 Nationalities of climbers

❄️ Seasonal patterns and expedition risks

🏅 Notable peaks and their popularity

The goal of this project is to showcase how data visualization can uncover hidden stories within real-world datasets.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Tableau → For dashboards and interactive data visualization

MS Excel / CSV Dataset → Data source for preprocessing

📸 Dashboard Previews

Here are some snapshots of the dashboards created in Tableau:

🚀 Key Insights

The number of expeditions increased significantly after the 1950s.

Spring and Autumn emerged as the most favorable climbing seasons.

Everest remains the most attempted peak but with a high risk factor.

Climbers from [X, Y, Z countries] dominate expedition records.
