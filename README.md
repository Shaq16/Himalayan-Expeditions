🏔️ Himalayan Expeditions – Data Analytics with Tableau
📌 Project Overview

This project is a data analytics case study on Himalayan expeditions, focusing on trends, patterns, and insights derived from expedition datasets. Using Tableau, I built interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore aspects such as:

📊 Number of expeditions over time

🧗 Success & failure rates of climbs

🌍 Nationalities of climbers

❄️ Seasonal patterns and expedition risks

🏅 Notable peaks and their popularity

The goal of this project is to showcase how data visualization can uncover hidden stories within real-world datasets.
